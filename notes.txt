network protocol:
Literally the only thing that the cc server will ever receive is files
It will then respond with a single number indicating the response
its very simple
	the only thing the cc server will get is files, and the only thing the
	client will ever get is response numbers

create a folder for logs and a folder for screenshots
create a timer for dumping that is seperate from the timer for logging
write a log about every minute and then dump every few hours
when the time comes to dump, combine all logs inside log folder into a master_log
send this master log, along with all of the images to the cc server which will receive
and organize the files. If the success response is reached, then proceed to delete all
screenshots and logs including the master log, if failure is reached, then delete the master log
and wait until the connection works. If the kill response is reached, then delete all the files and close the program

# Instead of combining logs, just append to the master log every time a log is reached (append time and date of log at top of keylog)
# save logs and screenshots in same directory
# so basically, encrpyt the keylog string in memory, and then append it to the log file
# for screenshots, take screenshot, compress, encrpt, and then save in ss folder
# delete screenshots and logs as success responses are reached
	* so that means that the algorithm shoud be
	* 
	* initialize connection
	* if connection fails
	*		return	// will build up files in reserve
	* else if connection succeeds
	* 	go into cache directory
	* For each file
	* 	send file
	*		await response
	* 	check response
	* 	if response is success
	*			delete file
	*		else if response is kill
	*			delete all files and close program
	*		else
	*			dont delete file
	* 

when screenshots are taken, make their filename a timestamp and then encrypt it
figure out how to run this program in the background

WHAT I ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO

Everything
	add encrpytion

Keylogging
	update logging scheme

Screenshots
	take screenshot
	compress into file
	name file after timestamp
	encrpyt file

Dumping
	fill in file transfer algorithm
	delete files after transfer
	implement kill switch
